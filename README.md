# BlockApps-OpenShift
### RUN THESE. These basically get the image from the BlockApps repo and then push it to OpenShift. Then we create a project called strato (the name is fixed for now).


sh getImages.sh (one time only)
oc new-project strato
sh setupImages.sh
sh startup.sh


You will then click on the nginx route (under Applications/Services). You will get the dashboard and create users, send ether and create contracts.

Pending : Need to fix the hardwired route in the env variables.
